This is a reboot of the CSim project which aims to better support the use of CellML models in SED-ML tools and OpenCMISS.
Please consider this very much a **work in progress**.

The initial aim is to separate the generation of an executable model from the actual numerical method being used to integrate
the model, and borrows heavily from code written for OpenCMISS (https://github.com/opencmiss/cellml) - which is now being
migrated to use CSim instead.
